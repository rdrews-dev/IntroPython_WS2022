    Get together in groups of three (max four) and prepare this small project as a conversation starter for the oral exam on Wednesday 16th in the time frame from 16:00 - 20:00. Note, this will only be a conversation starter and does not exhaustively cover all possible questions during the exam. You may also solve this problem individually.
