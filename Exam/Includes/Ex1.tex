\section{A GPS Station in Antarctica}

Load data \textit{XYShirase\_GPS\_Small.txt}. This datafile was recoreded by a GPS station on an Antarctica Ice shelf. The data structure is as follows:\\

col1: coordinate polar stereographic East (m)\\
col2: coordinate polar stereographic South (m)\\
col3: coordinate longitude (decimal degrees)\\
col4: coordinate latitude (decimal degrees)\\
col5: elevation (m, relative to WGS84)\\
col6: days (relative to an arbitrary date in the past)\\
\\
Visual the vertical coordinate as a function of time. Visualize the horizontal trajectory of the station. Fit a linear regression line to the horizontal trajectory. What is the approximate speed in meters per year?
