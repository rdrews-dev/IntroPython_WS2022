\section{A bit of geophysics, but not too much.}
The data file is a derived product from a radar survey in Antarctica. The radar was towed behind a skidoo with lots of driving around. The data format is as follows:\\
\\
col1: coordinate polar-stereographic East (m) \\
col2: coordinate polar-stereographic South (m) \\ 
col3: two-way traveltime to a sub-surface reflector (seconds) \\

Filter out all the NaN values. Visualize the skidoo-tracks in an x-y plot. Write a function that converts the two-way traveltime of the sub-surface reflector to a depth below the surface. Assume a radio-wave velocity of $1.72\cdot10^8$ m s$^{-1}$. What is the average depth of the sub-surface reflector in meters? Can you visualize this using the scatter function in matplotlib?
