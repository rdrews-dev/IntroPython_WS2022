\section{Smoothing Data}

Load data \textit{XYShirase\_GPS\_Small.txt}. This datafile was recoreded by a GPS station on an Antarctica Ice shelf. The data structure is as follows:\\

col1: coordinate polar stereographic East (m)\\
col2: coordinate polar stereographic South (m)\\
col3: coordinate longitude (decimal degrees)\\
col4: coordinate latitude (decimal degrees)\\
col5: elevation (m, relative to WGS84)\\
col6: days (relative to an arbitrary date in the past)\\

Visualize the vertical displacement as a function of time. The data are a bit noisy for your liking.
Smooth the data with a running mean. This means, write a for loop that goes through the data and for each point in time you average values in its surrounding.
This is called a running mean. It is not the best way to smooth data, but a good exercises. Write your own loop, don't use external functions.
