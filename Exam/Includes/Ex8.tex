\section{A bit of geophysics, but not too much.}
The data file is a derived product from a radar survey in Antarctica. The radar was towed behind a skidoo with lots of driving around. The data format is as follows:\\
\\
col1: coordinate polar-stereographic East (m) \\
col2: coordinate polar-stereographic South (m) \\ 
col3: two-way traveltime to a sub-surface reflector (seconds) \\

Filter out all the NaN values. Visualize the skidoo-tracks in an x-y plot. Write a function (containing a for loop) that calculates the total distance travelled. The function should stop the calculation if the distance between two datapoints is larger than 500 m.
