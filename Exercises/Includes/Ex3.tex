\section{Functions and loops}

\subsection{Reading in user input, endless loops}
Almost all programming languages that support loops can also have endless (infinite) loops, that is loops that never end.
Besides a \verb|for| loop Python also has a \verb|while| loop. The syntax is very easy:


\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    While loop 1
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/While1.py}
\end{tcolorbox}

To finish a loop in Python just use the \verb|break| keyword:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    While loop 2
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/While2.py}
\end{tcolorbox}

In order to read an input from the user via keyboard Python has the \verb|input()| function:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    User input 1
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/Input1.py}
\end{tcolorbox}

To convert a string into a number Python has two functions: \verb|int()| and \verb|float()|.

Now write a function that reads in numbers from the user and calculates the total sum and prints this value at each iteration.
The program should also print out all the numbers sorted (ascending) at the end. In order to quit the program the user has to enter \verb|'quit'| instead of a number.

\ifanswers
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    User input 2
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/UserInput.py}
\end{tcolorbox}
\fi

\subsection{Reading data from multiple files}
At some time you have to read in multiple files one after each other and combine all the data.
One way of doing this is to specify the files in a list:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    Multiple files 1
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/Files1.py}
\end{tcolorbox}

Another way is to specify a file pattern and to load all the files that have that pattern in their name:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm,
    colback=blue!5!white,colframe=babyblueeyes,title=Solutions,
    watermark color=white]
    Multiple files 2
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{Src/Ex3/Files2.py}
\end{tcolorbox}
